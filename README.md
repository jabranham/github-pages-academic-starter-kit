This is a starter project for making an academic webpage using github pages. There is a live preview of this [available here](https://jabranham.com/github-pages-academic-starter-kit/)

Feel free to fork this project in order to get your own site going. You should be able to fork it and rename it to `<your-username>.github.io` to get started. Please note the license, below.

Also note that the setup has recently changed - the site now relies on `jekyll`'s themes engine. The default theme is minima (and, as of this writing, that's the only one available). Here's a link to [a list of supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/).

Here's a list of things you'll probably want to do right away:

* Change the personal information in the `_config.yml` file (name, email, description, etc)
* Update the `index.md` file to whatever you want. This is the "homepage" for your website.
* Create whatever subpages you want. I've included `teaching.md` as an example template. So that would be served at www.yousite.com/teaching.
  * These pages will automatically appear in the site's header at the top.
  
That's probably enough to get started right now. Feel free to contact me with any questions you have!
